Registration for ESPM-157 follows the campus staged process with reserved seats for several of the specific majors in the host department (ESPM) as determined by Rasser College of Natural Resources (RCNR) scheduling and academic advising staff. All seats go quickly, so please plan to enroll as soon as you are eligible to do so. Students in ESPM-based majors should speak to their major adviser about enrolling in ESPM-157 and reserved seats.  Please do not contact course instructors about permission to enroll or enrollment codes for reserved seats, this process is handled by RCNR Scheduling to be as fair and equitable as possible across student groups needing this course to meet graduation requirements.  We are constantly exploring ways to expand access to this course without degrading the educational experience. <strong>Graduate students</strong> interested in 157 should consider <a target="_blank" href="https://espm-288.carlboettiger.info" rel="noreferrer">ESPM 288</a>, usually offered each Spring.</li></ul><h2 id="format-and-assessment" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Format and assessment</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#format-and-assessment" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><ul><li><p>This course centers around our in-class experience. We meet for 2 hours twice a week for a <em>hands-on, group-based experience</em> facilitated by your instructors. Lectures will not be recorded because there will not <em>be</em> lectures. Built on decades of education research and delivered in the most recent state-of-the art Active Learning Classroom on campus, this course emphasizes a collaborative learning-by-doing approach in all elements. Today, there are a wealth of lectures in data science that can be viewed freely without a university tuition. Education research shows the value of hands-on, peer based experience which we have the opportunity to create in our classroom. We recognize that things happen and students will not be penalized if they cannot make a session</p></li><li><p>The course is built on four open-ended modules and final project.  In each, students will work in pairs (and occassionally individually) to replicate or refute the main scientific findings of a key paper or result in global change ecology.  Each module is selected to introduce a core set of competencies in data science, fundamental concepts in global change ecology, and new skills for reproducible research and data-driven communication.</p></li></ul><h2 id="prerequisites" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Prerequisites</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#prerequisites" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>This course has no formal prerequisites. Prior experience with programming in any language can be helpful. This course is uniquely structured with open-ended assignments that can be accessible to first time programmers or challenge experienced software developers.</p><h2 id="office-hours" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Office hours</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#office-hours" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><ul><li>TBD</li></ul><h2 id="communication" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Communication</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#communication" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Guided by education research, our course design seeks to emulate the feel and experience at the cutting edge of Data Science research today. Technical communication platforms are a core component of this. Learning Management Systems (LMS) typically used in instructional settings do not provide an authentic experience. Students will be introduced to communication and collaboration tools including GitHub and Slack for most communication purposes.</p><h2 id="grading" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Grading</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#grading" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:</p><table><tbody><tr><th class="">component</th><th class="">weight</th></tr><tr><td class="">Final Project</td><td class="">30%</td></tr><tr><td class="">HW Exercises</td><td class="">60%</td></tr><tr><td class="">Participation</td><td class="">10%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Grading rubrics will usually be provided with each module.
It is expected that students in this course will have a wide range of prior experience
and ability, and grading will aim to reflect learning and effort in the course.
This course is not graded “on a curve” compared to other students.
Grades will reflect relative individual learning and improvement from earlier benchmarks.
It is certainly possible for all students to receive high grades in this course
if all of you show mastery of the material and completely attempt all assignments.
However, high competency that does not reflect learning gains or the stylistic expectations of this
course may score quite poorly. Our course prizes concise, semantic code supported by clear
and insightful text and figures.</p><p>All assignments are due by immediately <strong>before</strong> the start of class on the day indicated. Assignments should be submitted as instructed.</p><h2 id="make-up-policy" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Make-up policy</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#make-up-policy" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Late assignments may be docked 20% and will not be accepted more than 48
hours late except in cases of genuine emergencies
or in cases where this has been discussed and approved in
advance. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to
use computers well, students should be working with them at multiple times
each week. Time has been allotted in class for working on assignments and
students are expected to work on them outside of class. It is intended
that you should have finished as much of the assignment as you can based
on what we have covered in class by the following class period. Therefore,
even if something unexpected happens at the last minute you should already
be close to done with the assignment. This policy also allows rapid
feedback to be provided to students by returning assignments quickly.</p><h2 id="code-of-conduct" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Code of Conduct</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Our course is committed to providing a respectful and welcoming

You will definitely learn more
in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions,
answer questions, and share ideas liberally. <strong>Please identify your
collaborators by name on all assignments</strong>.</p><p>Since you’re working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the
course instructor informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes
you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop
the course for any reason, please don’t just disappear silently! You
should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on you
to do something you can’t finish.</p><h2 id="generative-ai" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Generative AI</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit px-2 font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#generative-ai" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Generative AI is very much a part of the modern data science landscape and

You do not need a
fancy machine -- any device with a keyboard, web browser and wifi should be sufficient
to connect to our cloud-based compute platform which will be doing all the heavy lifting.
