  This course is divided into separate modules, each designed to give you a hands-on experience working in teams to reproduce or examine a fundamental result in global change ecology.  Each module will also introduce a different type of data and different tooling to handle it, as described in the summaries below.  You will spend a few weeks working through each module in your team, largely at your own pace. Weekly readings and introductory live-code sessions will provide some necessary background, but real learning will happen only by doing.  Most of the questions in your assignment for each module do not have 'right' answers, but involve open ended research to fully explore.  Students without prior statistical or computational experience should be able to complete initial exercises, while teams with greater prior experience are expected to push those boundaries by going deeper into the analysis and presentation. Workflow and communication are central elements to each module.  All work should appear in professional and well documented format using RMarkdown notebooks in the project GitHub repository and pass all automated checks on Travis-CI.

    <strong>What is the evidence for a changing climate?</strong> In this unit, we will examine some of the most important indicators of global climate change:  
    including CO2 concentration, global mean temperature, sea level rise, land ice sheet melt, 
    and arctic sea ice cover.  We will wrangle a wide range of tabular data file formats used by
    NOAA and other agencies and introduce the fundamentals of data visualization with <code>ggplot2</code>
    and data processing with basic functions from the <code>readr</code>, <code>tidyr</code>, and 
    <code>dplyr</code> packages as we 
    seek to replicate the principle results of climate change over the last decades and also the
    past thousands of years.

      <strong>The last fish in the sea?</strong>
      In a paper in <emph>Science</emph> in 2006, Boris Worm and colleagues seized international headlines
      and fueled an ongoing scientific controversy when they documented the persistent declines
      of fisheries on a global scale.  In this module, we will explore the evidence behind these
      controvertial results using some of the best publicly available data from global fisheries
      stock assessments.  This will introduce us to techniques for working with relational databases,
      where the data we need is spread across multiple tables. We will get deeper into `dplyr` and
      related tools.

      <strong>How will changing climate conditions drive species range shifts?</strong>
      This module provides an introduction to the fundamentals of working with spatial vector and
      raster data in R.  Our approach places an emphasis on the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features">Simple Features Access</a> standard
      (ISO 19125) and tidyverse-style workflow using the <code>sf</code> package and emerging
      ecosystem of <a href="https://r-spatial.org">r-spatial</a> tools.

      <h3><i class="material-icons">widgets</i> Non-rectangular data</h3>
      <strong>Are we experiencing the sixth mass extinction?</strong> In this unit, we will
      attempt to estimate the current rate of species extinctions across major taxa and compare
      this against the background rate of extinctions in the fossil record; replicating seminal
      work from a series of papers by Tony Barnosky and colleagues.  Though rectangular data frames
      have formed the core unit of our analysis so far, to answer these questions we will learn to
      work with non-rectangular data.  This module will introduce the fundamentals of working with
      non-rectangular data in the JSON format returned by a REST API. We will also encounter the use
      of Regular Expressions for extracting information from unstructured textual data.
