#  website for ESPM 157

As part of our course migration into python, this website is now being built with jupyter-book, and still under development.

For reference, see the [course website](https://espm-157.github.io/website-r/) for the R-based version of this course, last taught in Fall 2023.  This version was built with `blogdown` / `hugo` using a custom theme based on the open source Material-Kit from Creative Tim.
