blogdown::serve_site()
```

## Overview

`blogdown` sites use the popular static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io),
which dictates the organizational structure of this repository.  
Markdown (and/or `.Rmd`) source files for the pages can be found in `content/`.  

Rendered site files are found in `docs/` and hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
at <https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info>.

This site is built using [Material Kit](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit)
which implements Google's Material Design using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) CSS.
