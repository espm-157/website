Today we will continue to draw on these skills as we go deeper into the fisheries data in search of the evidence of the North Atlantic Cod collapse.  In the process, we shall pick up some new methods as well.\n",

    "Effectively all this has done is take our timeseries table and for each stockid, add extra columns explaining what the stock table tells us about the stockid - species names, areas, and so on. The join has made our data is much wider than before -- we have all the **columns** from *both* tables.  (Note that both tables happened to have one column with the same name, `stocklong`.  A truly tidy database would not have done this -- we can easily see that this information belongs in the stock table.  Because our database cannot assume these are the same when we join, it has renamed the one on the \"right\" (from timeseries) as \"stocklong_right\" to distinguish them).  Because each `stockid` was repeated in the timeseries table, now all this other information is repeated too.  This is not as inefficient as it may sound, thanks to internal optimizations in the database.\n",

    "While it is clear even from this `head()` preview that we have the columns from both tables, what about the rows?  Our stock table was already filtered to a subset of rows containing only Cod stocks.  This join (technically called an \"inner join\") has kept only those `stockid`s, so we now have timeseries only about Cod!  In fact, we could have instead joined the full tables for all stock ids, and then applied the filter for `commonname`. \n",
