      <description>Unit I: Climate Change Module Warm-up exercise: Examining CO2 trends in R  Example from http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ Raw data from ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt  Which months are the CO2 values at the maximum? Minimum? Why is this?
What rolling average is used in computing the “trend” line? How does the trend depend on the rolling average?

      <description>Projects should essentially look like any of our modules, but with you identifying the dataset and questions rather than working from a template. You may choose to replicate a figure from an existing study, but are also encouraged to use this opportunity to perform some exploratory analysis on data you may be using in your DS421 team projects or your own dissertation research. Remember that as with modules, finals will be graded on workflow and presentation rather than particular conclusions.</description>
