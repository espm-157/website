    "# `ibis` Single Table Verbs\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing on how to use the `ibis` package, a successor to the popular `pandas` package, for manipulating tabular data. We begin by importing the `ibis` package.   (We include two additional imports from the package which are commonly referred to using their short names, the table placeholder `_` instead of `ibis._`, and the selectors methods as `s` instead of the verbose `ibis.selectors`.  We will see these in action later). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- establish a connection with `duckdb.connect()`\n",
    "- use `head()` and `excute()` to preview large data\n",
    "- use `select()`, `distinct()`, `filter()` to explore data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `ibis`, we must also select a backend.  We will always be using the quite new and very powerful `duckdb` backend for all of our tasks.  We select a backend by creating a \"connection\".  The details here are not important for us, we can treat this first block as \"boilerplate\" starting code.  \n"

    "We are now ready to read in our data.  We will begin by reading the metrics table from the direct access link, as indicated in the URL below.  `con.read_csv()` is quite similar to the `pandas.read_csv()` we saw in module 1, though the optional arguments get some different names and are not quite as flexibile.  One important option for our purposes will be the how to indicate missing values.  In the past, we've seen negative values like `-99` be used to indicate missing values.  That convention reflects limitations of early software, which had no natural concept of \"missing\". More modern conventions indicating missing values as \"NULL\" or \"NA\".  We indicate the data has chosen the latter:"

    "This doesn't look like a pretty pandas table! Where are the values?  Actually, as we become more familiar with `ibis` we learn to appreciate the display choice here.  `ibis` is designed for working with very big data. An important part of this is something called _lazy evaluation_. Even downloading a very large fle might take a long time, and trying to load a large dataset into python all at once can exceed available RAM and crash the kernel.  Instead, `ibis` merely \"peeks\" at the data over the remote connection -- without even downloading it! It tells us the names of each column and the data type (e.g. string, or numeric, etc) that the read_csv method has 'guessed' for the data.  As we will see, this is often the most useful information anway.  \n",

    "For python to know that we are looking for the column called \"tscategory\", we use the column selection `_.tscategory`.  This is actually a shorthand for the pattern `tsmetrics.tscategory` -- the `_` is a placeholder for \"the current table\" in our chain.  Extracting a single column with `.` is itself something of a shorthand, it is equivalent to using the selector `[`, as `tsmetrics[\"category\"]`.  When a column name is also the name of a table method, we may need to fall back on the square bracket convention.  So why use a dot at all?  In addition to taking two less characters to write, the `.` method allows \"tab completion\" of the column name, which helps us avoid typos.  Note that our `select()` method recognizes either syntax, you can do: `tsmetrics.select(_.tscategory)`.  This looks slightly more cryptic, but benefits from autocomplete and matches the sytnax of other functions.  \n",
